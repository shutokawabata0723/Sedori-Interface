# Purpose
If you are at depature of learning html, css and javascript, these programs and files would be tips.<br>
This interface is usually used for my sedori activation (getting money by selling merchandises on amazon).<br>
But, I thought that this interface can be used for learning html, css, and javascript.<br>
It is difficult for begginer to know how html, css and javascript connect to one another.<br>
